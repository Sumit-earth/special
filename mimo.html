                        It was the date of 2nd june 2023. And me along side with Deepanshu was all set to visit the cycle store and we did.
                        The only plan I had in mind was to buy the most simple cycle out there and what followed there us there was unexpected.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first cycle store was full of lights,tiles sophisticated cycles. And most importantly one uncle who was as manipulative as anyone could be. We walked out of the store after sensing the hostility.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 </p>
                <p>
                   We went to the next store just in front of the previous one, it was not that well decorated to attract the mass. But it had what it takes to be a successful enterprise "Passion and Courtesy". Both the owner and the staff were good at what they did.
                   Bingo we had Mimo- Tata Stryder .

                <p>
                   With all these passing years in life now I feel the things that come randomly are the things that go  on forever and ever.
