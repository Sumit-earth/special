                        I want you to know. <br>
                        You look good in every color, <br>
                        And every color looks better on you. <br>
                        And the best part is.. <br>
                        You look beautiful even when there are no colors on you.<br>

                       I want you to know. <br>
                        You have a sweet pretty face. <br>
                        As gentle as rose in my garden. <br>
                        But I want you to know, <br>
                        I believe you for your heart that is even golden than gold.

                       <!-- Be honest with what You feel, <br>
                       And standing out for ourselves. <br>

                       I want you to know.. <br>
                       It is not our job to make everyone happy, <br>
                       Happiness and expectations are a mutual thing, <br>
                       It is like a string being hold by two persons <br>
                       And if other person cuts that string <br>
                       Just leave it.. -->
