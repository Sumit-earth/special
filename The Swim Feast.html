                <p>So now I am in resturant currently developing this web page and I seriously don't know what you will feel after reading all of this. But I am very clear with my intentions. I feel like making this now so I am making all of this. So just sit back and relax. The best part is... someother day for sure.</p>
            <h3>The <span>First</span> Leap</h3>

            <div class="blog_swim">
                    <p>
                        It was my first day at the pool and with that first leap my mouth was filled with pool water and the second  thing I knew was the water had leaped to my stomach.
                     The first day was special in every aspect I struggled, I enjoyed and what not. The instructor was generous and seemed to have a keen interest on mentoring us. Had a few important lessons on swimming that day. It really helped a lot.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well I could learn how to swim on the first day nor I was expected to. But that first day had filled me with all the curiosity I had needed to be in the pool unless  I learn how to swim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 </p>
                <p>
                    With each progressing session, I was improving. And on the the fourth day of the practice I was able to lean in and out a bit and this was my Eureka moment. I had unlocked the code to swim and it was Ypu have to loose your body entirely free and let the water thrsut upon you. and then just with a little push we could swim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I am not a master swimmer but these practice sessions made me realize that we can achieve what we aim for. It also taught me the power of perseverance and continuos efforts.

                    You know about my weird music taste. Right. And I feel things need not be rational all the time. So here I am sharing you a list of few songs. Just click on these and enjoy whenever free..
