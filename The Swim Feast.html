            <h3>The <span>First</span> Leap</h3>

            <div class="blog_swim">
                    <p>
                        It was my first day at the pool and with that first leap my mouth was filled with pool water and the second  thing I knew was the water had leaped to my stomach.
                     The first day was special in every aspect I struggled, I enjoyed and what not. The instructor was generous and seemed to have a keen interest on mentoring us. Had a few important lessons on swimming that day. It really helped a lot.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well I could learn how to swim on the first day nor I was expected to. But that first day had filled me with all the curiosity I had needed to be in the pool unless  I learn how to swim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 </p>
                <p>
                    With each progressing session, I was improving. And on the the fourth day of the practice I was able to lean in and out a bit and this was my Eureka moment. I had unlocked the code to swim and it was Ypu have to loose your body entirely free and let the water thrsut upon you. and then just with a little push we could swim.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I am not a master swimmer but these practice sessions made me realize that we can achieve what we aim for. It also taught me the power of perseverance and continuos efforts.
